name of the function : checkvalid()
description : this function takes the aurgument passed by enterpokemon() function i.e name of the 				   pokemon.
			  it loops through the json(pokemon database inside assignment.js) using for in loop
			  it then compares name attribute in the object with the name passed as parameter, to see if they are equal or not
			  this is done by converting both the string to upper case and comparing using === operator.
			  note: if you compare both string without converting it to uppercase it may miss match due to case sensitivity e.g Diglett will not be same as diglett. hence I converted both to uppercase before comparing
			  It returns true if the strings match else it will return false
